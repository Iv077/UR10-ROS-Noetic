Content:

Code capable to catch an object with certain parameter,
explained in "Assignment Description”. The code runs,
alternating parameter, check true the different axis
the errors with the objective of reaching a Cartesian
error under 0.05 and an orientational error smaller 
than 5.

The code runs the robot true commands in ROS Noetic, in 
combination with python and by sending and receiving 
messages true nodes.

Asigment Description:

A ball is thrown with a certain velocity and direction 
from above the robot.
The launch is repeated, always with the same parameters, 
but the actual values are unknown to the robot. The task 
is to catch the flying ball with the robot end effector, 
by adjusting the position and orientation for 
intercepting its falling trajectory, according to the 
outcome of previous launches.

After you move the robot to a certain location, the ball 
is released, and you receive feedback on:

 1) the minimum distance (in mm) between end effector and 
 ball falling trajectory. You only get the distance, not 
 where the effector is with respect to the ball.

 2) the angular deviation (in degrees) between the ball 
 falling direction and the end orientation at the minimum 
 distance.

The ball is considered caught only if both distance and 
angular deviation are below their respective thresholds. 
You need to devise an algorithm that adjusts position and 
orientation of the robot end effector according to the 
feedback received at each ball launch.

Once the object is caught, a new object will be thrown with 
different parameters, so the algorithms need to work within 
a range of different initial values. You can use any algorithm,
but only using the feedback values, not the initial parameters 
or the trajectory points, which are always unknown to the robot.

The reference frame has the origin at the base of the robot 
arm, with the y axis facing forward from the robot (y>0 in front), 
the x axis laterally (x>0 on the right), and the z axis vertically
(z>0 up). The launching speed v0 will vary between 0.5 and 1.5 m/s, 
the downward angle(w.r.t. to xy plane) between 0° and 45°, the 
lateral angle (w.r.t. yz plane) between -15° and 15°. Any friction 
is ignored, and g = 9.81 m/s2 is the only acceleration.

Distance threshold for considering a catch successful is 0.05m. 
Orientation deviation threshold is 5°. We suggest you solve the 
problems in two steps, by including only distance threshold to start 
with. When the system works consistently for different initial values,
add the constrain on orientation.
